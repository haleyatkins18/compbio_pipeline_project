# compbio_pipeline_project
This pipeline is for the computational biology (COMP483) Spring 2024

# Description 
Human herpesvirus 5 is also known as Human cytomegalovirus and is typically abbreviated as HCMV. Cheng et al. 2017 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29158406) sequences the transcriptomes of HCMV post infection. This pipeline uses bioinformatics tools (Bowtie2, SPAdes, and command-line BLAST) to find the most similar HCMV strain to the two patient donor HCMV transcriptomes

This code is meant for and test in Python3.8
